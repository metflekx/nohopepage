#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Sxte8qkS-s
#### Description:
no hope is a very simple webapp.the porpuse of nohope is to serve as a presonal website for me to upload
my music , the directory structure is just like it's written in flask docs.
inside static folder there are 3 folders nested, one for css in which i have written the style, the next
dirs are images and music which are self explanatory.
i also written two javascript files , one of wich(app.js) is included in my layout template and applies to
all the templates, and one specifically for song.html template.
then there is templates directory which of course include all the templates i used html, and jinja in all of 
the templates.
there is my db file which i store all the data too keep track of users info and comments etc. 
app.py contains all the code for web application which i've written in python using flask and a few other libs.
i created helpers.py just to make my project more readable.
